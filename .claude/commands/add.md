description: "Add a task to the Initiative queue"
argument-hint: "<task description>"
---

Add a task to the Initiative queue using `add_task`. Use the user's argument as the task title. If the argument is detailed enough, also extract a description from it. Set a reasonable priority (50 for normal tasks, 80+ for urgent ones). After adding, confirm the task was created and show its ID.
